# Flexbox Practice – NOVI Frontend Module Assignment

## About the Project

This repository contains my solutions to a Flexbox assignment for the Frontend Development module at [Novi University](https://www.novi.nl). The goal is to master the use of **CSS Flexbox** for positioning, alignment, and layout-building — progressing from simple alignment tasks to constructing full page layouts and a custom landing page.

## Assignment Structure

### Part 1: Flexbox Positioning

> Focuses on aligning flex-items inside flex-containers using properties such as `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `align-self`.

### Part 2: Building Layouts with Flexbox

> Introduces more complex layouts using `flex-basis`, `flex-grow`, and `flex-shrink`.

### Part 3: Landing Page Design

> Final challenge: build a simple landing page using your own HTML and Flexbox-based layout.

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** – Semantic structure
- **CSS** – Focus on Flexbox (no Grid, no positioning)

---

## Key Flexbox Features Practiced

- `display: flex` and `flex-direction`
- `justify-content` / `align-items` / `align-self`
- `flex-wrap` for responsive row breaking
- `gap` for spacing without margins
- `flex-basis`, `flex-grow`, and `flex-shrink`
- `order` for reordering layout visually
- Nested Flex containers
